 * 3D Renderer - DSP polygon command interpreter + textured model rendering

 * DSP command protocol (from Ghidra decompiled game code):
 *   0x8000 (6 words):  place object, relative to camera
 *   0x8002 (13 words): place object with rotation matrix
 *   0x8008 (15 words): set transform context (matrix + position)
 *   0x8009 (4 words):  set render parameters (CZ/fog type)
 *   0x800a (6 words):  render model at position
 *   0x8010 (2-4 words): end frame / end list
 *
 * Point ROM polygon format (chunkLength-based parsing):
 *   model_id -> pointrom[model_id] = addr1 (object list)
 *   pointrom[addr1+N] = object addresses (-1 terminated)
 *   Each object: word[0] = chunkLength, then sequential packets.

 * screen (state 3 sub 23) the cursor reads 0x10400, the base, on every frame,
 * and the walker then read the entire stale buffer -- the CONTROLS tutorial had
 * left an 18-record rider chain in its tail, under the shorter mode-select list
 * that later frames had overwritten the prefix with. Measured: f1800 (sub 13)
 * 10 objects, f1805 (sub 23) 28 -- the extra 18 being codes 119-136 and 163,

 * just advances the cursor and returns -- so a phase that emits a short list
 * left the walker running on into the PREVIOUS frame's commands.

 * reproduce it (over 1201 steered gameplay frames the terrain chunks show ZERO
 * dropouts and the only real flicker is rider parts 75/76, register row 114's
 * residual). So instead of guessing at which model it is, this watches the
 * drawn set live and prints every object that was on screen, vanished for a
 * few frames, and came back -- with its model id, so it can be rendered and
 * identified.

 *   PROPCYCL_BLINKMIN=<n>          frames it must have been present first (default 10)
 *
 * It only reports a model that had been drawn steadily first, so objects
 * legitimately entering and leaving view are not flagged. An ANIMATION CYCLE
 * looks like a blink too -- models that alternate on a fixed period (779/780
 * every 4 frames, 327/332 every 32) are the game's own frame sets, not a bug --

 * The SKY is attached to the eye, not the scene, so it is rotated about the
 * eye (t' = t . R) and not dollied. HUD / screen-space viewports are left
 * alone. Nothing here runs unless g_pausecam_on, so unpaused output is

 * depth-buffer-precision z-fight cannot occur. The analogous defect here is
 * two quads from DIFFERENT objects whose zsort keys are so close that a
 * one-unit difference in either (camera motion, a sub-pixel projection
 * change, anything that nudges the 24-bit key by a handful of counts) could
 * flip their draw order between frames -- which reads on screen exactly like
 * z-fighting does on hardware with a depth buffer: a flicker where either
 * surface can "win". Quads are sorted by zsort, so a near-tie is always
 * adjacent (or a few slots away, when more than two quads cluster at one
 * depth); this only has to look at each quad's next few neighbours, not
 * every pair. Screen-space bbox overlap is required too -- two near-tied
 * quads that do not share any pixels cannot flicker into each other. */

 *
 * The user-visible symptom of getting this wrong is exactly the "black wedge"
 * the pre-row-101 comment here described, and it was never the stale
 * pre-row-87 measurement that comment dismissed it as: under ZXY the flyover
 * sky is rotated ~90 degrees about the wrong axis, so its rim cuts a diagonal
 * across the frame and the clouds sit at an angle instead of filling the
 * screen. Ground truth is unambiguous -- MAME's own CPU words for code 108
 * at attract_start/poly_f180 are [15800, 28706, -23170, 23170, 0, 32767] and
 * ours are [15800, 28712, -23170, 23161, 0, 32767], identical bar trig-table
 * rounding, so the producer was never the problem. The master composes those
 * words into [0.707 -0.341 0.6194 / 0 0.876 0.4822 / -0.7071 -0.341 0.6194],
