/*
 * input.c — SDL2 input into the paths the game actually reads.
 *
 * WHERE THE GAME READS INPUT (traced, not guessed)
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Buttons and coins arrive through the MCU shared RAM, and the game copies
 * them itself every frame (input_read_service_buttons, game_misc.c):
 *
 *     W[0x2B80] = commsram[0x7D02];  W[0x2B82] = new & ~old   (edge)
 *     W[0x2BA4] = commsram[0x7D04];  W[0x2BA6] = new & ~old   (edge)
 *
 * So writing W[0x2B80] / W[0x2BA4] directly -- which this file used to do --
 * is DEAD: the game overwrites both from commsram on the next frame. Coin
 * insertion never worked for exactly that reason. Everything button-shaped
 * therefore goes into commsram and reaches the game through its own code.
 *
 * The analog values are the opposite case: on hardware the MCU supplies
 * them, and here this file is that source, so those go in directly.
 *
 * They go into _W[] and NOT into work_ram. Writing work_ram cannot express
 * them: the two 16-bit values sit 2 bytes apart, and sync_wram_to_W turns
 * a 4-byte-aligned offset into ONE 32-bit slot -- so a BE16 pair at
 * 0x2BC8/0x2BCA read back as _W[0x2BC8] = 0x01FF01FF (both halves merged)
 * instead of 0x1FF, and the game's `W[0x2BC8] - W[0x3FD0]` deflection was
 * nonsense. The sync layer's PIN mechanism (wsync_pin, game_stubs.c) is
 * what makes the direct write stick: the four slots are registered in
 * input_init() so sync_wram_to_W leaves them alone. Without the pin they
 * are a fixpoint -- the sync runs before anything reads them and resets
 * them to last frame's work_ram bytes.
 *
 * The CENTRES W[0x3FD0]/W[0x3FD2] are set here too. The game's own
 * analog_center_read_from_mcu() is reached only from the stubbed
 * eeprom_settings_init(), and copies BYTE-wise (`W[0x3FD0+i] =
 * commsram[0x7D0A+i]`), which yields 0x01 rather than 0x1FF. Left to
 * itself the centre reads 0 and the bike sits permanently hard over.
 *
 * BIT ASSIGNMENTS, from MAME's INPUT_PORTS_START(propcycl) (namcos22.cpp):
 *     0x0001 COIN1   0x0004 SERVICE1   0x0008 TEST   0x0100 START1
 * The port is IP_ACTIVE_LOW at the connector, but the MCU firmware inverts
 * it before shared RAM -- the game tests `W[0x2B80] & 8` for test mode and
 * computes edges as `new & ~old`, i.e. a press must SET a bit. So the
 * values written here are ACTIVE HIGH. The low byte of INPUTS lands at
 * 0x7D02 and the high byte (START1) at 0x7D04.
 *
 * ANALOG RANGE, from the same port definitions:
 *     ADC.0 handlebar X: centre 0x1FF, range 0x0BF..0x33F, PORT_REVERSE
 *     ADC.1 handlebar Y: centre 0x1FF, range 0x0BF..0x33F
 * The old code used centre 0x200 and range 0x080..0x380; the 0x200 is the
 * documented L3 divergence at WRAM 0x02BC8 (tools/l3/masks/attract.mask),
 * where MAME reports 0x1FF.
 *
 * THE PEDAL IS NOT AN ANALOG AXIS -- it is a PULSE ENCODER, and it is now
 * mapped as one. MAME models it as a 1-bit optical sensor whose PULSE RATE
 * encodes speed (propcycl_state::pedal_update): it clocks MCU timer A3 and
 * the MCU firmware counts interrupts. Writing a level into an ADC channel
 * cannot reproduce that, which is why this was left unmapped for so long.
 *
 * The game-side read HAS now been located. input_process_analog_deltas
 * (game_system.c, M68K 0x0223B8) reads a FREE-RUNNING 16-bit counter from
 * MCU shared RAM at 0x7D1A + axis*2 and takes its per-frame difference into
 * W[0x2BFC + axis*8]. Axis 1 lands in W[0x2C04], which
 * player_update_prev_pos turns straight into thrust:
 *
 *     W[0x0D80] = W[0x2C04] + 1;  W[0x0D80] = W[0x0D80] * 0x4a >> 4;  ...
 *     W[0x0D48] = W[0x0D8C] + ((W[0x0D80] + W[0x0D48]) - W[0x0D84]);
 *
 * So this file's job is to be the MCU: advance that counter at the rate a
 * real pedal would pulse. pedal_counter_update() below uses MAME's own
 * interval curve so the top speed comes out where the hardware's does
 * rather than at an invented constant -- see the note on it.

 * consumer, and the WHOLE accumulated difference was delivered as one frame's
 * thrust the moment the game resumed.
 *
 * Measured, from a player's own recording (`flight_rec.c`): one frame in 1327
 * reported **31612 pulses** where the per-frame maximum is ~11 -- 2916 frames,
 * 48.6 s, of accumulation. It drove the speed to **151066** against the
 * hardware's measured top of 13940 (register row 54) and moved the bike
 * **11920 units in one frame** where it normally moves 380. Five frames of
 * that carried it ~46000 units -- half a grid cell -- straight through the
 * terrain, and it ended buried at y=40932 with the pitch snapped from -1674
 * to 66963. The player reported this as "hitting a wall in the tunnel"; the
 * tunnel had nothing to do with it.
 *
 * Splitting the two halves fixes it at the source and needs no clamp in the
 * transpiled ROM code: `input_pedal_sample()` tracks the LEVEL every poll (so
 * the ramp still follows the key), and `input_pedal_step()` advances and
 * publishes the counter exactly once per simulated frame, which is what the
 * hardware does -- on the real machine the 68K differences the MCU's counter
 * every frame and never stops. The delta is then bounded by construction.
 *
 * This is also why a teleport is so destructive here: at 11920 units/frame
 * the bike moves further in one step than the collision look-ahead reaches
 * (the escape-probe radius table tops out at 31744, and the per-frame sweep
