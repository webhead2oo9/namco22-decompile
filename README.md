# Namco System 22 games for PC

Namco arcade games from the 1990s, rebuilt so they run on a normal
computer. You need your own copy of each game's files (the MAME versions);
they are not included here. A ROM set from **MAME 0.271 or later** is
supported; the chip unpacker also accepts a few older chip-name spellings
where a MAME set has since renamed one (see [docs/ROM_CHECKSUMS.md](docs/ROM_CHECKSUMS.md)).

| Game | Year | Status | Online play | Game files you need | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Prop Cycle** | 1996 | Playable from start to finish, with sound | no | `propcycl.zip` | yes | yes |
| **Rave Racer** | 1995 | Playable: races, with sound | **yes**: up to 8 players, LAN and internet ([how](#playing-online)) | `raverace.zip` + `namcoc74.zip` | yes | yes |
| **Tokyo Wars** | 1996 | Playable: attract, play, sound, widescreen | no | `tokyowar.zip` | yes | yes |
| **Dirt Dash** | 1995 | Playable: five stages, sound, widescreen | no | `dirtdash.zip` | yes | yes |
| **Time Crisis** | 1995 | Playable: attract, three-coin play through the stages, the operator's test mode, sound, widescreen; **the mouse is the gun**, and light guns work (see below) | no | `timecris.zip` | yes | yes |

**Are you running the same ROMs as the authors?** The checksums of every ROM file the games use are in
[docs/ROM_CHECKSUMS.md](docs/ROM_CHECKSUMS.md), with a list in `md5sum` format for each game.

**No extra BIOS file.** Earlier instructions asked for `c71.bin` or MAME's `namcoc71.zip` (the DSP's BIOS). The games have it built in now, so you never need it; if you have it, ignore it.

## Download (nothing to build)

Each release on the [Releases page](https://github.com/spacestate1/namco22-decompile/releases) has ready-made packages.
**None of them contains game files**: after installing, you put your own zips in a folder (the `INSTALL.txt` next to the packages says where).

| Package | For | How to install |
|---|---|---|
| `namco22_VERSION_amd64.deb` | Ubuntu 22.04 or newer, Linux Mint 21 or newer, LMDE 6, Debian 12 or newer | `sudo apt install ./namco22_*_amd64.deb` |
| `namco22-VERSION-1.fc40.x86_64.rpm` | Fedora 40 or newer | `sudo dnf install ./namco22-*.x86_64.rpm` |
| `PropCycle-x86_64.AppImage`, `RaveRacer-...`, `TokyoWars-...`, `DirtDash-...`, `TimeCrisis-...` | **The Steam Deck**, and any 64-bit Linux without installing anything | `chmod +x` the file and run it (on a Deck: Desktop Mode, right-click it > Add to Steam) |
| `windows-release-VERSION.zip` | Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit | Unzip it anywhere, put the game zips in its `roms` folder, double-click the game's `.exe` |

On Linux, start a game from the applications menu (or type `propcycle`, `raveracer`, `tokyowars`, `dirtdash` or `timecrisis`). The first time, it makes the folder
`~/.local/share/namco22/<game>/roms`, tells you which zip is missing and copies any it finds in `~/Downloads`. To uninstall: `sudo apt remove namco22`
(or `sudo dnf remove namco22`); your game files, settings and scores stay in `~/.local/share/namco22/`.

**Steam Deck:** download the AppImage of each game you want, put your ROM zips in `~/.local/share/namco22/<game>/roms/` (Desktop Mode: Dolphin > Ctrl+H shows the
hidden `.local` folder; zips in `~/Downloads` are found automatically), then in Desktop Mode right-click the AppImage > *Add to Steam* (or Steam >
*Add a Non-Steam Game*) and start it from Game Mode. The AppImages use the Deck's own SDL2, so Steam Input works: the menu opens with **R3** or by holding
**Start** for a second. Each AppImage uses the same folders as the `.deb`, so the ROMs and settings are shared. If an AppImage will not start, run it from a
terminal (`./DirtDash-x86_64.AppImage`) and read the message; on a system without FUSE, `--appimage-extract-and-run` works.

The AppImage names carry no version number, so **updating is overwriting the file** and a Steam shortcut keeps working. ROM zips placed **next to the
AppImage** (or in a `roms` folder beside it) are found too. **Portable mode:** make a folder named `namco22-data` next to the AppImages and each game
keeps everything there (`namco22-data/<game>/`: its roms, the unpacked chips, settings, scores and recordings) instead of `~/.local/share/namco22` --
one disk, e.g. a microSD card, then works the same on a Steam Deck and another PC. The Windows zip is portable already (everything lives in its folder).

## How it was made

Each game's original program was taken apart with
[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) (the NSA's free reverse-engineering tool)
and checked, piece by piece, against the arcade machine running in
[MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/).

- **Prop Cycle**: Ghidra's output was turned into C and fixed by hand.
- **Rave Racer**: the program is translated to C by a tool of this project
  (`raverace/gen/rr_lifted.c` is its output), and parts are being rewritten
  by hand.
- **Tokyo Wars**: the program is translated to C by the same tool
  (`tokyowar/gen/tw_lifted.c`); its master DSP and sound programs are
  turned into C when you build, from your own copy of the game files.
- **Dirt Dash**: the program is translated to C by the same tool
  (`dirtdash/gen/dd_lifted.c`); its master DSP and sound programs are
  turned into C when you build, from your own copy of the game files.
- **Time Crisis**: the program is translated to C by the same tool
  (`timecris/gen/tc_lifted_NN.c`, 16 parts); its master DSP and sound programs are
  turned into C when you build, from your own copy of the game files.
  It is the newest game here: the program's code was checked against MAME's
  own coverage of the real game, and the DSP and sound translations against
  the interpreters they were made from; it has **not yet been compared with MAME
  frame by frame or note by note**, so expect small differences.
- The sound programs of all five games are turned into C when you build,
  from your own copy of the game files.

This repository has **only the code**. It has no game files and no Ghidra
project or tools. Everything the games show or play is read from your own
zips.

## What you need to build it yourself

- **Your own copy of each game's zip** (see the table at the top). They are needed while building, not only while playing: each game's sound program
  and DSP program is turned into C from them.
- **Linux (64-bit):** a C compiler (`gcc`), `make`, CMake, `pkg-config`, the SDL2, OpenGL (Mesa) and zlib development files, and Python 3 with numpy.
  `./install-deps.sh` installs all of these on Debian / Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, openSUSE, Alpine, Void and Gentoo.
- **Windows programs** are built from Linux (`./build-windows.sh`): the MinGW-w64 cross compiler (`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`), CMake, `make`, `curl`, `7z` (p7zip)
  and Python 3. The first run downloads SDL2, zlib and Mesa (the fallback OpenGL for computers with no graphics driver), so it needs the internet.
- **Building the `.deb`, `.rpm` and Windows zip the way a release is made** is done by the author with a script that is not part of this repository (it needs
  Podman for the Ubuntu and Fedora containers); you do not need it to build or play.

## Linux

Open a terminal in this folder. First, once:

```bash
./install-deps.sh
```

This installs the tools the games need. It asks for your password.

Then build each game you have. Change the paths if your zips are
somewhere else:

```bash
./build.sh ~/Downloads/propcycl.zip                                       # Prop Cycle
raverace/build.sh ~/Downloads/raverace.zip ~/Downloads/namcoc74.zip        # Rave Racer
tokyowar/build.sh ~/Downloads/tokyowar.zip                                 # Tokyo Wars
dirtdash/build.sh ~/Downloads/dirtdash.zip                                 # Dirt Dash
timecris/build.sh ~/Downloads/timecris.zip                                 # Time Crisis
```

Rave Racer's, Tokyo Wars', Dirt Dash's and Time Crisis' first builds take a few minutes.

Then play:

```bash
./launch.sh prop      # Prop Cycle
./launch.sh rave      # Rave Racer
./launch.sh tokyo     # Tokyo Wars
./launch.sh dirt      # Dirt Dash (`./launch.sh dirt jungle` starts in a stage: city, jungle, hill, mountain, snow)
./launch.sh tc        # Time Crisis (the mouse is the gun)
./launch.sh           # the list of games and options
```

## Windows

All four games run on Windows. The Windows version is built from Linux. Type:

```bash
./build-windows.sh
```

This makes a `windows-release` folder. Copy it to the Windows computer.
Put the game files in its `roms` folder: `propcycl.zip` for Prop Cycle,
`raverace.zip` and `namcoc74.zip` for Rave Racer, `tokyowar.zip` for Tokyo
Wars, `dirtdash.zip` for Dirt Dash, `timecris.zip` for Time Crisis. Then double-click **PropCycle.exe**,
**RaveRacer.exe**, **TokyoWars.exe**, **DirtDash.exe** or **TimeCrisis.exe**.

Building on Windows itself, and what in the code is there for Windows only:
[docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md).

## How to play

**Prop Cycle.** You fly a pedal-powered glider and pop balloons.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `5` | Put in a coin |
| `Enter` | Start |
| Arrow keys | Steer and tilt |
| `Space` | Pedal |
| `Esc` | Menu (restart, exit, sound, levels, screen) |
| `P` | Pause. While paused, the arrow keys turn the camera around the rider and `+` / `-` zoom |
| `F12` | Take a picture |

**Rave Racer.** A street race against the clock.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `5` | Put in a coin |
| `X` (or Up) | Gas |
| `Z` (or Down) | Brake |
| Left / Right | Steer |
| `A` / `S` | Shift down / up |
| `V` | Change the view |
| `F2` | Test mode on / off (press again to leave it) |
| `9` | Service |
| `P` | Pause |
| `Esc` | Menu |
| `F12` | Take a picture |

<a id="playing-online"></a>**Playing online (Rave Racer).** Up to eight players can race together, each on
their own computer. Open the menu with `Esc` and go to the **Online** page,
then **Host / join a game...**:

- **Local LAN**: one player picks *Host a LAN game*; everyone else picks *Find
  LAN games* and clicks the game it finds.
- **Internet game**: type the address of a server (`host` or `host:port`, UDP
  27750 by default) and *Connect*. Anyone can run such a server on a machine
  that is always on: `raverace/server/` is a small Rust program for exactly
  this (see its README; the wire protocol is `raverace/NETPLAY.md`).

Everyone in the lobby then picks **Ready**, and anyone can start the race once
all players are ready. When the race begins the game turns free play on for
you and gives everyone a moment to step on the gas; choose your car and wait
for the others at the course select. Your name on the Online page is what the
other players see.

**Tokyo Wars.** You command a tank in a city battle.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `5` | Put in a coin |
| `Enter` | Start |
| Left / Right (or `A` / `D`) | Steer |
| Up / Down (or `W` / `S`) | Forward / backward pedal |
| `X` / `Z` | Right / left trigger |
| `9` | Service |
| `F2` | Test mode on / off |
| `Esc` | Menu (screen, sound, keys) |
| `P` | Pause |
| `F11` | Full screen |
| `F12` | Take a picture |

**Dirt Dash.** An off-road race against the clock.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `5` | Put in a coin (a game costs two) |
| Left / Right (or `A` / `D`) | Steer |
| `X` | Gas |
| `Z` | Brake |
| `Q` / `E` | Shift down / up |
| `C` | Select (change the view, confirm) |
| `M` | Motion stop |
| `9` | Service |
| `Esc` | Menu (screen, sound, keys) |
| `P` | Pause |
| `F11` | Full screen |
| `F12` | Take a picture |

A game controller works in all the games. In Rave Racer the keys can be
changed in `raverace/rr_controls.cfg`; in Tokyo Wars and Dirt Dash, in the menu
(**Controls**) or in `tokyowar/tw_controls.cfg` / `dirtdash/dd_controls.cfg`.

**Time Crisis.** A light-gun shooter. **The mouse is the gun.**

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| Mouse | Aim |
| Left button (or `Space`) | Shoot (also starts the game and picks menu items) |
| Right button (or `Z`) | The foot pedal: step out of cover to attack, step back, reload |
| `5` | Put in a coin (a game costs three) |
| `9` | Service |
| `F2` | Test mode on / off (the operator's menu: shoot inside the screen = up, outside = down, pedal = enter) |
| `F8` | A white border round the picture (cycles its width; some light guns need it) |
| Arrow keys / a pad's right stick | Aim without a mouse; `A` / right shoulder shoots, `B` / left shoulder is the pedal |
| `Esc` | Menu (screen, sound, keys) |
| `F11` / `F12` | Full screen / picture |

**Light guns.** A gun that acts as an absolute mouse (Sinden, Gun4IR, OpenFIRE, Reaper, AimTrak) works as it is: aim at the screen and shoot.
To **reload**, aim a little OFF the screen and shoot (the pointer sits on the window's edge, which the game reads as "off screen"), or hold `R` or the
gun's side button. The widescreen picture keeps the game's 4:3 aiming area in the middle. Guns with their own calibration need it done once in their own software. Not tested here: any real light gun hardware.
A VR headset's controllers are a gun too: see [VR headsets](#vr-headsets).

**Choosing a stage.** `--stage 1`, `--stage 2` or `--stage 3` on the command line starts the game's own **Timed Game** at stage 1, 2 or 3 (unlimited lives, a best time per stage):
the coins are put in and the choices made for you, then the gun is yours. It works from the attract screens, not during a game.
**No crosshair:** *Esc > Display > Crosshair* turns the red aiming
cross off (a real light gun needs none).

**For testing** (environment variables, set before starting the game): `TC_INF_TIME=1` keeps the clock from running out and
`TC_INF_LIFE=1` gives back every life lost, so a test can reach the later scenes of any stage. They act only during a game.

**Steering with the stick** (Tokyo Wars and Dirt Dash): *Esc > Controls > Stick steering* sets how the stick turns
the wheel. **Medium** (the default) is gentle near the centre and still reaches full lock at the edge; **Smooth** and
**Very smooth** are gentler still; **Linear** turns the wheel in step with the stick.

**On a game pad or a Steam Deck** (no keyboard): the menu opens with **R3**
(click the right stick) or by **holding Start for a second** (a quick tap is
still the game's own Start). The cabinet's **Test mode** (the service switch,
`F2` on a keyboard) and **Service** button are in the menu too -- the **File**
page in Rave Racer and Prop Cycle, the **Controls** page in Tokyo Wars and
Dirt Dash. Test mode is a switch: turn it on to enter the operator menu (its
screen says which controls choose, enter and change a value), turn it off from
the menu to leave. A hint on the screen says how to open the menu for the first
few seconds after the game starts, when a pad is connected.

## Screen settings (Prop Cycle, Tokyo Wars, Dirt Dash and Time Crisis)

Press `Esc` and open **Display**. Your choices are saved by themselves.

- **Widescreen**: turn it on to fill a wide screen. You see more of the
  world at the sides, not a stretched picture. The time and score gauges
  move out to the corners.
- **Window mode**: a window, or full screen.
- **Resolution**: how many pixels the game draws. It is scaled to fit the
  window, so a smaller number runs faster on a slow computer.
- **Aspect ratio** (when widescreen is off): 4:3 like the arcade screen, or
  stretched to fill the window.
- **Frame rate** (all five games, Rave Racer included): how many pictures a
  second are shown. **Auto** (the default) follows your display -- 60 on a
  60 Hz screen, with vsync -- or pick a fixed 24, 30, 50, 60, 75, 90, 120,
  144, 165 or 240. The game itself always runs at the arcade's speed (just
  under 60 frames a second), whatever you pick and whatever your graphics
  driver's vsync setting is: a lower number shows fewer pictures, a higher one
  shows each picture more than once for a smoother picture on a fast monitor.

## VR headsets

Every game can be played in a VR headset, on a big screen in front of you, **in 3D**: the world goes back behind the
screen and near things stand out in front of it, while the time, score, speed and radar stay flat on the screen. In Time
Crisis the motion controllers are the gun; in the other four they are a game controller.

```bash
./launch.sh tc --vr     # Linux (and prop, rave, tokyo, dirt)
TimeCrisis.exe --vr     # Windows (and PropCycle.exe, RaveRacer.exe, TokyoWars.exe, DirtDash.exe; or a shortcut with --vr after the program's name)
```

It needs an OpenXR runtime that is running and set as the computer's OpenXR runtime: SteamVR, Meta Quest Link,
Windows Mixed Reality, Monado and so on. Without one, the game says why in its log and plays in the window as
usual. In VR the window shows the left eye, in a 640 x 480 window (`--window N` makes it bigger) even when the
game is set to full screen: the menu lays itself out in the window, and a bigger one would make it small in the headset.

**The menu** shows on the screen in the headset. The menu button opens it (Index and Windows Mixed Reality: click the
right stick; Vive: click the right trackpad). In the menu the controller is a pointer: point and pull the trigger.
`B` / `Y` or the menu button closes it; except in Prop Cycle (a mouse menu) the stick also moves and `A` / `X` chooses.
Its **VR** page (in Prop Cycle, the **VR** menu) sets the **screen distance** (0.5 to 5 m; 1.5 m to begin with), the
**screen size** (100 % is life size: the game's own field of view), the **3D depth** (0 is a flat screen; 100 % is
life size, and more than that pushes the far distance past what the eyes can comfortably look into) and **recenters**
the screen. They are saved by themselves.

**Time Crisis:**

| Controller | What it does |
|---|---|
| Trigger | Shoot (the hand that pulled its trigger last is the gun) |
| Grip | Foot pedal |
| `A` / `X` | Coin |
| `B` / `Y` | Put the screen straight in front of you again |

To reload, point off the screen and shoot, as at the arcade. The recoil is a short buzz in the gun hand.

**Inside the game's world (Time Crisis).** The VR page's first row, **View**, puts you inside the game instead of in
front of a screen: you stand where the game's camera is and look all around its world, life size, in 3D, and your head's
moves move you in it (**3D depth** is the world's scale). The time, score and bullets stay on the screen in front of you
(its distance and size are the rows for it). The game itself can only be shot inside its own picture, the part of the world
its camera is looking at, so **Outside the game's view** sets how bright the rest is: 40 % to begin with, from "as bright"
to "dark". An enemy you see there can't be hit until the camera turns to it; a shot there is off the screen. `B` / `Y` puts
the game's view in front of you again. The arcade's white flash when you shoot isn't shown inside the world.

**Prop Cycle, Rave Racer, Tokyo Wars and Dirt Dash:** the two controllers are one game controller, the left one its
left half (`X`, `Y`, the left stick and trigger) and the right one its right half (`A`, `B`, the right stick and trigger),
so each game's controller buttons work as they do on a pad.

| Controller | Prop Cycle | Rave Racer | Tokyo Wars | Dirt Dash |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Left stick | Steer and lean | Steer | Steer | Steer |
| Right trigger | Pedal | Gas | Forward pedal | Gas |
| Left trigger | | Brake | Backward pedal | Brake |
| Click the left stick | Coin | Coin | Coin | Coin |
| `A` | Start | Gas | Start | View / select |
| `B` | | Brake | Right gun trigger | Motion stop |
| `X` / `Y` | | — / view | Left gun trigger / start | Shift down / up |
| Grips (left / right) | Service / — | Shift down / up | Left / right gun trigger | Shift down / up |

- The 3D follows the game's camera: a zoomed-in shot (a replay's telephoto, a close-up) has less depth, so its far
  world goes no farther than the game's normal view puts it.
- **Frame rate** doesn't apply in the headset: the headset shows the pictures at its own rate (and turns the view with
  your head at that rate), and the game runs at the arcade's speed as always. The row is greyed out while VR runs; your
  choice is kept for the window.
- On Linux the game talks to the headset through X11 (XWayland on a Wayland desktop): OpenXR's OpenGL link on Linux needs it.
- On Windows `openxr_loader.dll` sits next to the games; only `--vr` uses it.
- Tested on Windows with a real headset (Time Crisis), on the Steam Frame (Time Crisis and Tokyo Wars; below), and all five
  games in the [OpenXR Simulator](https://github.com/webhead2oo9/OpenXR-Simulator) under Wine.

## Steam Frame

All five games run on the Steam Frame as its own programs (the Frame's SteamOS is Linux for ARM chips: nothing goes
through Proton), in the headset, with the Frame's controllers. They are built on the Frame itself, which has everything
that takes. Put this folder and your zips on the Frame, then in a terminal there (or over `ssh` from a PC), as on any Linux:

```bash
./build.sh ~/Downloads/propcycl.zip                                       # Prop Cycle
raverace/build.sh ~/Downloads/raverace.zip ~/Downloads/namcoc74.zip        # Rave Racer
tokyowar/build.sh ~/Downloads/tokyowar.zip                                 # Tokyo Wars
dirtdash/build.sh ~/Downloads/dirtdash.zip                                 # Dirt Dash
timecris/build.sh ~/Downloads/timecris.zip                                 # Time Crisis
```

Each takes 5 to 12 minutes on the Frame. Then add each game to Steam as a non-Steam game: the program is `launch.sh` in
this folder, the launch options `prop --vr` (or `rave --vr`, `tokyo --vr`, `dirt --vr`, `tc --vr`), and in its
properties include it in the VR library. It starts in the headset from your library; **View** opens the menu and
**File > Exit** ends the game.

The Frame's controllers are the halves of a game controller, and each button is that controller's own:

| Frame controller | Time Crisis | Prop Cycle, Rave Racer, Tokyo Wars, Dirt Dash |
|---|---|---|
| Triggers | Shoot | The pad's triggers (the table above) |
| `A` / `X` | Coin | The pad's `A` / `X` |
| `B` / `Y` | Put the screen straight in front of you | The pad's `B` / `Y` |
| D-pad (left) | | The pad's d-pad; it also steps through the menu (not Prop Cycle's: point at it) |
| Grips and bumpers | Foot pedal | The pad's shoulder buttons |
| Click a stick (left / right) | | Back (coin) / Start |
| Menu (right) | | Start |
| View (left) | The menu | The menu |

- The game is the same as on a PC: the ARM build does the x86 build's arithmetic, and the games' memory over their
  first minute (sampled every 5 seconds; Prop Cycle's every frame) is the PC build's, byte for byte.
- The headset shows 72 pictures a second; the game runs at the arcade's 59.906. The first time a scene appears, the
  Frame's graphics driver prepares its shaders, which can cost a short stutter; it keeps them for next time.
- The Frame's own head sensor, which Linux lists as a joystick, is left alone.

## If it does not work

- **"not installed"**: run `./install-deps.sh` again.
- **"can't be used"**: the zip is the wrong game or version (compare your files with
  [docs/ROM_CHECKSUMS.md](docs/ROM_CHECKSUMS.md)). Prop Cycle
  needs the one called `propcycl`; Rave Racer needs `raverace` and
  `namcoc74`; Tokyo Wars needs `tokyowar`; Dirt Dash needs `dirtdash`; Time Crisis needs `timecris` (World, TS2 Ver.B).
- **"still missing dt2vera.1"** (Dirt Dash): the program chips `dt2vera.1` and `dt2vera.2` were not found
  in `dirtdash.zip`. They can be at the top of the zip, in a `dirtdasha/` folder or in any other folder, or
  in a separate `dirtdasha.zip` beside it. If the message says the chip "cannot be used", it says why (wrong
  size, damaged zip, or a compression method that is not Deflate or Store).
- **"c71.bin is missing"**: that message is from an older version. The DSP's BIOS is built in now, so
  `c71.bin` and `namcoc71.zip` are not needed; update to a current build.
- **Black or white screen**: update your graphics driver.
- **Slow, or the picture stutters.** Open the game's log (`raveracer.log`, `tokyowar.log`, `dirtdash.log`, `timecris.log`,
  `propcycl.log` beside the `.exe` on Windows; the terminal window on Linux) and look at these lines:
  - `[HOST] OpenGL: ...` (Prop Cycle: `OpenGL: ...`) names the graphics chip the game is using. It should be
    your graphics card, for example *NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti*. If a laptop with **two** graphics chips shows the
    weaker one (*AMD Radeon Graphics*, *Intel ...*), the game is on the wrong chip. If it says *llvmpipe*,
    *GDI Generic* or *Microsoft Basic Render Driver*, it is drawing in software: install the graphics driver.
  - `[HOST] display N Hz, vsync` or `timer-paced`, and every 600 frames `[PACE] ... interval mean 16.7 ms`.
    Interval near 16.7 ms with few frames over 20 ms is a steady 60 fps. `[POST] final colour stage: GLSL` is the
    fast path; `pixel map (slow)` is not: please send us that log.
  - **Laptops with two graphics chips, Windows:** the newest builds ask Windows for the fast chip themselves. If
    yours still uses the other one, set it by hand: *Settings > System > Display > Graphics*, add the game's `.exe`,
    *Options > High performance* (or *NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D settings > Program settings*).
  - **Linux, two graphics chips:** `__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia ./launch.sh dirt`
    (or `prime-run ./launch.sh dirt`); with AMD or Intel drivers `DRI_PRIME=1 ./launch.sh dirt`.
  - Plug the laptop in and pick a *Best performance* power mode. On a 120/144/165 Hz screen the games still run at the
    arcade's 60 Hz, which looks uneven; a 60 Hz screen mode is smoothest. A lower *Esc > Display > Resolution* also helps.
