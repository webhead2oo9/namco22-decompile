/*
 * vaddr.h - Unified M68K virtual-address type + safe read/write helpers.
 *
 * Purpose: eliminate the two classes of transpilation bugs documented in
 * CLAUDE.md:318 by giving every M68K address a proper 32-bit type that
 * does not silently truncate when passed through function signatures,
 * and routing every dereference through the existing memory HAL instead
 * of casting raw integers to host pointers.
 *
 *   vaddr_t        = uint32_t, wide enough to carry any M68K address.
 *                    Use in signatures wherever Ghidra wrote 'short' or
 *                    'int' for something that is actually an address.
 *
 *   vrd8/16/32     = unsigned big-endian read at a vaddr_t.
 *   vrd8s/16s/32s  = signed variant (matches the (int16_t)*(uint16_t *)
 *                    Ghidra idiom).
 *   vwr8/16/32     = big-endian write.
 *   vptr(a)        = backing host pointer for bulk copies; NULL if unmapped.
 *
 * These wrap mem_read / mem_write / mem_ptr (memory.c), which already
 * handle region dispatch (ROM / work_ram / dspram / palette / ...) and
 * byte order.
 *
 * Rewrite patterns (hostile -> fixed):
 *
 *   (int16_t *)(0xB0938 + off) deref          ->  vrd16s(0xB0938 + off)
 *   (int *)(&R[0x15C328] + W[x]*4) deref      ->  vrd32s(0x15C328 + W[x]*4)
 *   (char *)(W[0x2908] + W[0x0990]*4) deref   ->  vrd8 (W[0x2908] + W[0x0990]*4)
 *   scene_node_render((short)ptr)             ->  scene_node_render((vaddr_t)ptr)
 *
 * The last one is the important signature change: stop storing pointers
 * in 'short' or 'int' parameters. Replace them with vaddr_t throughout
 * the call chain. Width is preserved and bugs become compile errors.

/* ---- half-word access into a 32-bit _W[] slot -------------------------
 *
 * THE SINGLE MOST COMMON ENDIANNESS BUG IN THIS TREE.
 *
 * Ghidra emits `*(short *)(int_ptr + N)` for a 16-bit field inside a
 * 32-bit word. On the big-endian M68K that reads the TOP half. Converted
 * naively to the _W[] model it becomes `(short)W[slot]`, which takes the
 * BOTTOM half -- a different field, usually a plausible-looking small
 * number, so it fails silently.
 *
 * Measured example (player animation nodes, ROM 0x12ACAC):
 *     w1 = 0xFFFF0001   hi = -1 (parent link)   lo = 1
 * The high half selects the emission branch in scene_node_render; the low
 * half is always 1. Reading the low half sent every node down the wrong
 * branch and the rider never rendered.
 *
 * Use these instead of a cast, always:
 *     W_HI16(s)  the field at byte offset +0 of the word  (M68K *(short*)p)
 *     W_LO16(s)  the field at byte offset +2 of the word  (M68K *(short*)(p)+1 in BYTES)
 */

/* Half-word STORES into a _W slot. M68K `move.w #v,(a0+N)` writes the HIGH
 * half of the 32-bit word at N when N is 4-aligned and the LOW half when
 * N is 2-mod-4; keep the other half intact. Never store a 16-bit literal
 * into the whole slot -- see the parent-link bug in bicycle_ik_solve. */

/* ---- 16-bit ARRAY inside the _W[] model -------------------------------
 *
 * A few work-RAM tables are int16_t arrays, not int32_t ones. The M68K
 * addresses element i of the table based at WRAM byte offset B as
 * `(B, dn.l*2)` with a .w access -- e.g. `tst.w $e0478c(d0.l*2)` at ROM
 * 0x011580, `addq.w #1,$e0478c(d0.l*2)` at 0x01165C.
 *
 * _W[] holds the 32-bit word at each 4-aligned byte offset, so element i
 * lives in the HIGH half of the slot at ((B + i*2) & ~3) when that offset
 * is 4-aligned and in the LOW half when it is 2-mod-4. Indexing such a
 * table as W[B + i] (stride 1) or W[B + i*4] (stride 4) is wrong twice
 * over: it reads a whole slot where the machine reads a half, and it
 * spreads the array over 2x or 4x its real extent, so it collides with
 * whatever work RAM follows.
 *
 * Unlike a bare 2-mod-4 slot these never address one, so sync_wram_to_W
 * cannot eat them and no wsync_pin is needed.                          */
