/*
 * tex_bake.c — the engine's texture pipeline (moved from Prop Cycle's
 * renderer_texture.c; identical on System 22 and Super 22).
 *
 * Implements the Namco System 22 / Super 22 texture pipeline:
 *   UV coordinates → tilemap lookup → tile pixel → palette color → GL texture
 *
 * The pipeline is two-stage (matching MAME namcos22_v.cpp renderscanline_poly):
 *   Stage 1: tilemap index = ((v_banked & 0xFFF0) << 4) | ((u & 0xFF0) >> 4)
 *   Stage 2: tile  = pr1ccrl[tilemap_index * 2] (16-bit LE)
 *            attr  = pr1ccrh[tilemap_index / 2]  (packed nibble, 4 bits)
 *            pen   = texture_tiles[tile * 256 + transformed_local_offset]
 *   Stage 3: color = palette[group * 256 + pen]
 *
 * Texture bank (texbank, from V word bits [15:12]) offsets V by texbank*0x1000.
 * Without texbank the tilemap lookup reads the wrong 256x256 tile region —
 * balloon models (ID 0x2CE-0x307) use texbank=1; terrain uses texbank=0.
 *
 * Palette groups (0-127) come from direct_palette (eng.h), which each game
 * fills; a group's generation (g_eng_pal_gen) is part of the cache key, so a
 * changed palette re-bakes rather than showing stale colours.

 * the six reference frames 4.13 -> 3.60, all of it on the two dense terrain
 * frames (f1500 7.72 -> 6.54, f4800 9.69 -> 7.68), and 1024 renders

 * almost exactly the texel count the OLD oversampling was already spending
 * (1127M vs 1125M over a 3600-frame autopilot level), which made it look
 * free.
 *
 * It is not free: big textures cost more per texel than small ones (upload

 *
 * So the cap stays 256 and quads over it are decimated by an integer step.
 * The way to actually close the remaining gap is per-pixel sampling in a
 * shader, as the raster note in CLAUDE.md has said all along -- not a

/* THE TABLE, NOT THE BYTE BUDGET, WAS THE LIMIT -- and that is why raising
 * the budget made things WORSE.
 *
 * This is linear probing with a 16-slot window at both ends: a LOOKUP gives
 * up after 16 probes and reports a miss even when the entry is stored
 * further along the cluster, and an INSERT that finds no free slot in 16
 * evicts an arbitrary victim (`tex_cache[h & MASK]`). Both degrade as the
 * load factor rises, so a bigger cache keeps more entries resident, clusters
 * grow past 16, and the false-miss and collision-eviction rates climb.
 * Measured over a full 9000-frame level at 16384 slots:
 *
 *      budget   frames over 12ms   worst frame   cumulative evictions
 *       448 MB      4049 / 9000      326 ms            145k
 *      1024 MB      2389             135 ms            268k   <- MORE
 *      2048 MB      1639              43 ms            385k   <- MORE STILL
 *
 * At 2048 MB the working set wants ~40000 entries and the table has 16384,
 * so it is permanently saturated. The late part of a course is where this
 * bites: the first 3600 frames never reach it, which is why every earlier
 * measurement in this file looked healthy.
 *
 * 65536 entries is ~2.6 MB of SYSTEM ram (the entry is ~40 bytes) and keeps
 * the load factor low enough that clusters stay short. The probe window is

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- a per-frame budget for COLD bakes (interactive hosts)
 *
 * Almost every frame of a race bakes nothing (median 0 texels; p99 300k) -- and then the first frame of a new scene needs every texture in
 * view at once: Rave Racer's mountain start bakes ~10 MILLION texels in one frame (50 ms here, 125 ms on a 1440p GTX 1660 -- the stutter
 * "slightly after the start"), and the frame after it another 1.2M. At ~5-12 ns a texel that is many missed vsyncs.
 *
 * With a budget, a frame that has already baked `draw` texels serves further cold quads a COARSE PLACEHOLDER -- the same texture sampled
 * every 4th-8th texel (cap 32: 16-64x cheaper, cached under its own key) -- and remembers them; the next frames re-bake the most recently
 * requested (= nearest, the draw order is far to near) at full quality, `pump` texels a frame, and any quad drawn again in a frame with
 * budget to spare takes its full bake on the spot, so nothing stays coarse. A scene change sharpens over a few tenths of a second instead
 * of freezing. Small quads (<= 32 texels a side) are always baked in full: they cost nothing.
 *
 * OFF unless a host asks (tex_bake_window_defaults) or ENG_TEX_BUDGET=<draw>:<pump> (texels; "0" = off), so headless runs and every gate
 * bake exactly as before. Needs g_eng_frame to advance once per shown frame (Rave Racer's and the Super 22 compositors do; Prop Cycle's
 * does not, so it must not enable this). */
