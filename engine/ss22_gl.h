/*
 * ss22_gl.h -- a Super System 22 frame through the shared engine, from the board's RAM (engine/ss22_gl.c).
 *
 * The composition Prop Cycle's renderer does (src/renderer_3d.c geohw_flush + geohw_draw_text), lifted out of that file
 * so a game that is not Prop Cycle gets it without a copy: the master DSP's display list walked and painter-sorted with
 * the C374 sprites merged into the SAME z order (MAME queues both into one radix tree), Super 22 per-pixel CZ fog
 * applied after shading, the mixer's poly fade, the screen fade, the text tilemap on top, and the mixer's gamma over
 * the whole frame. Pixel-exactness of each layer is the shared modules' (fog_hw, sprite_hw, text_hw, quad_gl); what a
 * game supplies is where its RAM is.
 *
 * Everything is 640x480 in scene units; a wider window widens full-frame viewports (Hor+) through g_scene_x0/x1.
